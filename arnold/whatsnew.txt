Core:
- fixed a bug in the AY-3-8912 I/O port handlers. Now emulated exactly like the hardware. Thankyou
to Russell Marks for his discoveries about the AY-3-8912 I/O port operation. [Russell Marks, Kevin Thacker]

Windows
- changed resource file so it could compile if MFC was not installed with Visual studio
- changed makefile.w32 so resources can be compiled with MingW

Linux:
- incorporates latest changes from Andreas Micklei (see whatsnew.linux for more details)

Emulation Core:
- tape image block "0x010" was not handled correctly. fixed. [Kevin Thacker]

30-September-2001
=================

- fixed graphics drawing in 24-bit and 32-bit display depths
- fixed rendering accuracy selections
- fixed snapshot loading/saving
- snapshots are more compatible with original CPCEMU file format
- added support for snapshot V3 format (as used in No$CPC) these can be read
and written now. The CPC+ chunk is not compatible with No$CPC as this does
not seem to follow the published document. V3 can be used to snapshot CPC+ programs/demos
- added snapshot command-line option to unix version
- fixed some sound bugs

02-September-2001
=================

- source release under Gnu Public License
- implemented Z80 interrupt Interrupt Mode 0 (usable in CPC+ mode)
- reverted monitor emulation back to original; no black bar down right side
- numerous fixes ("Simply the Best" demo now shows the scroller)
- provided makefile for MingW (doesn't include resources and no command-line); when I
  work out how to get the resources to compile I will add them
- provided makefile for linux/unix (may require adaption for different flavours of unix/linux)
- provided workspace and project compatible with Microsoft Visual Studio V6
