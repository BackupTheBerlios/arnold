- fixed rendering accuracy selections
- fixed snapshot loading/saving
- snapshots are more compatible with original CPCEMU file format
- added support for snapshot V3 format (as used in No$CPC) these can be read
and written now. The CPC+ chunk is not compatible with No$CPC as this does
not seem to follow the published document. V3 can be used to snapshot CPC+ programs/demos
