CORE FILES
==========

Z80
===

- rewrote the C version of the z80 emulation. It is faster and more accurate.
- implemented Z80 Flag bit 5 and 3 results for some operations.

Extra hardware
==============

- Can choose the hardware connected to the joystick port:
* Joystick (standard joystick), 
* Amx Mouse (A.M.X. Mouse hardware used in Amx Paint
and Art Studio), 
* Westphaser (Loriciel's Westphaser light-gun)  ** not working **
* a spanish lightgun (name unknown) ** still got problems **

- Kempston Mouse (can be used on Art Studio)

- Inicron RAM-ROM hardware. 
* 16 slots supported
* all functions supported except ROM slot.
* only difference: When RAM/ROM written to on a real CPC,
the screen shows the data written. In the emulator this is not
shown. 

- Virgin/Magnum Lightphaser emulation
* still got some problems with it

- Vortex RAM Expansion
* This appears to work with the roms that are on ftp.nvg.unit.no , but I am not sure
that the emulation is correct. If anyone can help furthur please e-mail me.

FDC
===

- Improved accuracy of FDC emulation
* Overrun condition is set (Psyborg will run)
* Data Transfer during execution phase of command takes 
correct time. (Musical loaders now almost run at the correct speed).
* delays and other  timings in the following commands are emulated. 
	+ read id (discology can detect number of sectors per track now)
	+ format

- fixed bug where Xexor disc image would crash when loading
- fixed a memory leak. If a track contained data and it was re-formatted,
then data was not freed properly.

- Simple floppy drive emulation. 
* cannot seek beyond track 0 or maximum number of tracks supported by drive (43 for 3" drive)
* seek and recalibrate commands take time - instead of being instantaneous.
* change drive LED emulation. It is now done at the correct time (whenever
a read/write operation is executed by the FDD). Changing the LED is slow,
and it was being changed to often, now it is only updated once a frame,
and is only set when a read/write operation is active on the drive.
The Unique Megademo musical loader no longer slows down the emulation.

General
=======

- improved accuracy of Multiface 2 emulation
- a different multiface rom can be chosen for CPC and PLUS mode. (There are two
versions of the Multiface 2, one for CPC and one for CPC+ models. The only different
is the rom. The rom was re-written to interface with the different CPC+ roms).
- changed memory granularity to 8k blocks to support Multiface 8K RAM and 8K ROM
- cleaned up parts of the code
- the amount of ram and configuration can be chosen. 
upported options are:
1. no extra ram (64k base ram only)
2. 64k ram expansion (equivalent to a standard 128k machine)
3. 256k silicon disk (Thankyou to Craig Harrison for letting me use his 256k silicon disk
to confirm how the ram selection mechanism works with it)
- changed the debugging code. It is now seperate to the core code.
- you can load tape programs from sample files. ".voc" and ".wav" are the only supported formats
currently. This feature works best with a good clear recording because there is no filtering
applied to the sample data. All files will be validated before loading.
- added support for CPCEMU style cheat database. See Misc->Cheats->CheatDatabase.
- Simple Cheat finding system

Sound/PSG
=========

- changed the conversion between PSG volume and sample output to be logarithmic.
The sound is more accurate and dynamic.
- improved the quality of the digiblaster sound output. 
- handled PSG port 14 correctly. The keyboard will not work when Multiface is active, 
with NWC's PC1512 demo. This is the correct behavior.
- fixed many bugs, and improved sound output a lot.

CRTC
====

- improved accuracy of CRTC type 0 and 1.
- implemented CRTC type 2 emulation.
- implemented a partial simulation of the TV/Monitor. Effects which are
due to the response of the monitor should appear more accuratly (effects where
HSYNC and VSYNC are missed)


CPC+
====

- implemented undocumented features of CPC+ CRTC. (There are two status
registers which expose some of the internal comparisons of the CRTC).

- fixed DMA emulation. (Prehistorik II now works!)

- implemented 8255 bug where keyboard cannot be read.

TZX/Tape
========

- implemented full TZX tape image support. The current set of approx. 8 CPC tapes
which are in this format load and run correctly. TZX files are validated, so any dodgy
files that cannot be handled are not loaded.

YM3/YM5/StSound
===============

- you can now record in YM5 format. You can set the properties before recording.

KC Compact
==========

- implemented initial hardware emulation. The demo software which is available
from Andreas Kruger's website works perfectly.
- implemented partial Z8536 CIO chip. Programmable interrupts and some port features are done.

Windows version
===============

- the screen rendering method can be set in windowed and full-screen.
Low = original Arnold windowed display (every other horizontal pixel is missed to keep
aspect ratio)
High = all pixels plotted, with black lines inbetween to emulate effect of tv
Higer = all pixels plotted, lines are plotted in between.
- the emulator could crash if you ran it in 640x480 resolution from the desktop,
without reduced aspect. Now fixed.
- the emulator display was corrupted when switching between full-screen and windowed when using
a Riva TNT card. Now Fixed.
- cleaned up the DirectX code more, now there should be a lot less problems switching between fullscreen
and windowed in all colour depths
- implemented speed throttling. 
- multiface rom(s) and settings  can be accessed with "Multiface Settings" on the Misc menu.


Debugger
========

- registers can be edited. Click in edit box and type new values.

- some buttons removed from debugger dialog. Select views from the menu.

- Debugger Memory Dump View
* data can be edited in memory dump window.
* TAB toggles between editing Memory Address, data bytes and text.
* if memory address is edited, then memdump address will change.
* Cursor keys select bytes and move around memory. 
* Page up and page down to move up and down memory faster. 
* Text and data can be entered at any time. 
* Use mouse to select items. 
* View can be toggled between bytes and words ("V").
* windows fully resizeable
* removed toolbar. Right Click for a menu.
* Mem dump set address: Can enter a equation and the result will be the new address.


- Data search
* Can search for data. You can enter numbers in hex, decimal or binary, seperated with ",".
* Up to 16 bytes of data can be searched for. If you use "?" instead of a number, the byte at this
position will be ignored when searching. e.g. #06,?,#ed will search for any sequence with #06
as first byte, second byte can be any value, and #ed as the last byte.



- Debugger Dissassembly View
* dissassembly shows PC (">") and breakpoint locations ("*"). Breakpoints
are only shown in Z80 view. 
* Viewing of Opcodes ("O") and ASCII ("A") can be toggled.
* Breakpoints can be toggled at cursor position ("B"). (Z80 view only) 
* Dissassembly shows all undocumented instructions.
* Can move up and down view using cursor keys.
* can select any line with the mouse.
* windows fully resizeable
* removed toolbar. Right click for a menu
* press "V" to toggle dissassembly of z80 , dma channel 0, dma channel 1 or dma channel 2
instructions.
* page up and page down to move through dissassembly faster


- new Expression Evaluator
* can enter expressions to assign values to registers and more.
To specify a hex number, prefix with "#". To specify a binary
number prefix with "%". Decimal numbers do not need a prefix.
To use a register in an equation register use register name. 
You can specify 8-bit register names or 16-bit register names.

Most registers are named as you expect, here are a list
of the other registers and values you can use:

Register names:

ALT_AF		AF' (alternative registers)
ALT_BC		BC'
ALT_DE		DE'
ALT_HL		HL'
HIX			IX high byte
LIX			IX low byte
HIY			IY high byte
LIY			IY low byte
DMA0_PC		DMA channel 0 Program Counter
DMA1_PC		DMA channel 1 Program Counter
DMA2_PC		DMA channel 2 Program Counter 

- CRTC/CPC/CPC+ views
* ASIC DMA dissassembly has moved to new dissassembly view. 
ASIC DMA data is shown in view. (Addr, Prescale etc)
(can edit values. Click on numbers and type new values.)
(TAB cycles through values or click with the mouse to select
variables that have changed are shown in red)

Linux version
=============

- Changed Makefile so that the object files were not re-built
each time make was invoked.
- Updated host code for new core code changes
- can close display without using CTRL+C
